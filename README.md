# Interpretability of CNN during classification of PV

Testing out different interpretability techniques on CNN during classification of solar modules into mono-si panels, or poly - si panels.

### Description
<pre>
# Three techniques were tested, 
  1. LIME
  2. SHAP
  3. Grad CAM
  
# Main Objectives
  1. Construct a CNN to perform surpervised classificaion on "ELPV" dataset, classifying the solar modules to mono-si or poly - si modules
  2. To show that while classifying the CNNs focused mainly in the corner of the images, as mono-si panels have triangular cut outs and poly - si solar panels
     have no cuts, ie. they are a full square.
